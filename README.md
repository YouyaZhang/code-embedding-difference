This repository contains a pipeline for processing a modified version of the runbugrun dataset uploaded to HuggingFace, embedding buggy vs. fixed code pairs, and training a classifier to predict bug types.

## Repository Structure
- load_dataset.ipynb – Loads the runbugrun dataset, tokenizes buggy and fixed functions in chunks for later processing.
- EMBEDDER2.ipynb – Embeds the tokenized buggy–fixed pairs, computes the difference vectors between them, and saves these difference embeddings as files.
- classifier.ipynb – Uses the difference vectors to perform multi-label classification with hyperparameter search, predicting which bug labels correspond to each buggy function.

## Workflow

### Tokenization

- Uses load_dataset.ipynb
- Tokenizes buggy and fixed functions in chunks.
- Prepares the data for embedding.

### Fixed - Buggy Difference Embedding

- Uses EMBEDDER2.ipynb
- Creates embeddings for each buggy and fixed function.
- Computes the difference vector (fixed - buggy) for each pair.
- Saves the difference vectors as files for later use.

### Bug Label Classification

- Uses classifier.ipynb
- Loads the saved difference vectors.
- Runs a hyperparameter search to find the best model setup.
- Trains a multi-label classifier to predict bug types (mapped to integers).
